# Introduction

In this vignette, we demonstrate the use of the `DA2INFM` package, which provides various influence measures in regression models, including Cook's Distance, DFFITS, and Hadi's Influence Measure.

# Example Usage


```{r setup}
library(D3MINFL)
```

```{r}
# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```

```{r}
# Plot Influence Measures
plot_influence_measures(mtcars, model)
```
